I recently started as a PhD student at the Surgical Department, University Hospital of Zealand. I have 9 yearsâ€™ experience in the field of microbiology, of which 5 years were as a research assistant at Costerton Biofilm Center, University of Copenhagen. Here, we investigated the ability of bacteria to form biofilm as well as biofilms properties in infections, in order to improve diagnostics for patients with chronic infections. Before that, I was employed as a medical laboratory technologist for 5 years in a routine diagnostic function at the Clinical Microbiology Department, Rigshospitalet, where phenotypic and molecular methods were used to identify and determine the antibiotic sensitivity of microorganisms. I have a great interest in clinical microbiology and during my PhD I will combine this interest with a new specialty, colorectal cancer, where the relationship between certain bacteria and the presence of biofilm will be investigated in relation to colorectal cancer.
